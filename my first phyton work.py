# A simple program to work with a list of fruits
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
print("Hereâ€™s my list of fruits:", fruits)
fruits.append("elderberry")
print("I added a new fruit to the list:", fruits)
fruits.remove("banana")
print("After removing one fruit, the list is now:", fruits)
print("The first fruit in my list is:", fruits[0])
print("The last fruit in my list is:", fruits[-1])
#List Creation: I started by creating a list called fruits with a few items in it.
#Displaying the List: I printed the original list to see what it contains.
#Adding an Item: I used append to add a new fruit to the list.
#Removing an Item: I removed one fruit using remove.
#Accessing Items: Finally, I accessed and printed the first and last items in the list.
